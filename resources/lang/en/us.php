This CD got overall good reviews in different media as Rockzone or El Diario Vasco and gave them the opportunity of playing with big national bands like Dawn of the Maya, Bellako, Adrenalized or Hyde Abbey.<br><br>



      <strong>In 2015</strong>, after some months of non-stop touring, they lock themselves to start writing their next EP; Meltdown gets back to stages, they win several contests and publish their <strong>new single “Oxymoron”</strong>, a bridge between their first work and the upcoming CD.<br><br>

They also share stage with huge outfits such as Crisix, In Mute, Killus and Dawn of the Maya.<br><br>


      After a summer break, Meltdown comes back with <strong>several spanish dates</strong> programmed and a <strong>new bass player</strong>; Pablo Ferreras joins the band completing the line up.<br><br>


      In November 2016, Meltdown joins Atlas <strong>Artist Agency</strong>, a management and booking agency formed by Rove Hernando and Javi Carrion, tour manager and drummer from the almighty spanish thrash metal band <strong>Crisix</strong> and in early December 2016, they <strong>tour Europe</strong> for the first time in a 9 days run visiting France, Italy and Switzerland.<br><br>



      Last but not least, in  <strong>January 2017</strong> they announce a  <strong>new spanish tour</strong> as the support band for  <strong>Dawn of the Maya</strong>, spanish finest metalcore outfit, in the release tour for their third LP “Colossal”, turning Meltdown into one of  <strong>the most active bands in the spanish scene</strong>.<br><br>



      <span>From This Day To The Grave (2018 - Now)</span><br>



      In January 2018 Meltdown announces the release of their first LP called <strong>“From This Day To The Grave”</strong> as well as their signing with <strong>Art Gates Records</strong> (Spain and Portugal) and <strong>Imminence Records</strong>(USA). 

      This release brings the biggest highlights of the band's history: they tour non-stop through <strong>Europe with more than 25 shows</strong> outside their state, bringing their acts to countries like Germany, Switzerland, France, Czech Republic or Poland along many more. They also get into big festivals like <strong>Download Festival Madrid</strong> and Out of Sight Festival (POR), feature in major Spotify playlists like 'New Metal Tracks' and bring new music covering One Step Closer from the almighty Linkin Park for 'HCXHC Vol. 3', a charity compilation focused on helping cancer victims.<br><br>

      The act keeps on touring the whole year and signs to <strong>Stay Sick Records (US)</strong>, a rising core label that becomes the home of the band for the future releases along with bands like <strong>Dealer, Spite and InVisions</strong>. The band also hits the stage of <strong>Resurrection Fest 2019</strong>, the biggest metal festival in Spain, in a successful performance in front of thousands of people.
